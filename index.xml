      <description>Name&amp;rsquo;s Thiago, Brazilian name that translates to James or Jacob depending on who you ask.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineer from Brazil. Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve often worked in positions involving Software Development and understanding the business needs of businesses, large and small. My career exposed me to business challenges all over the world, with focus in emerging markets, especially Latin America. While in college, I always felt I would work on the &amp;ldquo;hardcore&amp;rdquo; Computer Science stuff but I ended up being more excited about using technology as a means to an end.</description>
